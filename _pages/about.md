I'm a software engineering manager in the Integrity org at Meta (aka Trust and Safety at other companies). Before I worked in Integrity, I built low-cost wireless networks in rural and poorly connected regions as part of the [Express Wi-Fi project](https://expresswifi.fb.com/).

In a previous life, I studied computer networking and programming languages at [Cornell](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/) from 2010 - 2015, and received my PhD under [Nate Foster](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~jnfoster/). I no longer keep up with research in this area, and am not able to accept paper review requests.
