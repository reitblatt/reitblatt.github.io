I'm a software engineering manager in the Integrity org at Meta (aka Trust and Safety at other companies) and a founding
member of the Civic Integrity team. Before I worked in Integrity, I built low-cost wireless networks in rural and poorly
connected regions as part of the [Express Wi-Fi project](https://expresswifi.fb.com/).

In a previous life, I studied computer networking and programming languages at [Cornell](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/)
from 2010 - 2015, and received my PhD under [Nate Foster](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~jnfoster/). I no longer keep up
with research in this area, and am not able to accept paper review requests.

Even before that, I received bachelors degrees in both [Computer Science](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/) and Mathematics
from the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/).

## Research Interests

I am broadly interested in the relationships between Internet platforms and communities, especially with respect to how
platforms cause harm to those communities through abuse or design.

More specifically, I am interested in the ways that platform design and policy impact the development and health of
communities, both online and offline.
